# Kartenspiele App
An app for counting scores of multiple card games like "Skat", "Golfen" and "Schwimmen". This app was an private side project during my first semester at university. 
The giol was to create an App for counting the scores for various card games which you could play with a poker deck. This was necessary because we played such game at
lunch and couldn't track our scores because we had nothing to write on.

This app was my second big development project after my first [school project](https://github.com/NachtaktiverHalbaffe/AHOJ-Jugendgottesdienst/blob/master/README.md). 
I used a persistend storage with the [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) and introduced a much cleaner architecture than the first time. 
There are still some bugs in it, but after the first working version I stopped working because I hadn't the time and the app does what I need.

I still use this app today at my own, but I don't work on it anymore. Maybe in the future I rewrite this entire app in Flutter.
